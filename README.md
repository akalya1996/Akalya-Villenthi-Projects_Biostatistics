**Project Title: Chest X-ray Image Classification for Pneumonia Detection**
**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for automatically classifying chest X-ray images into 
two classes: Normal and Pneumonia. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is trained on a dataset consisting 
of labeled X-ray images. The project involves data exploration, model development, training, and evaluation to create a reliable tool 
for assisting medical professionals in identifying cases 
of pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

**Project Components:**

**Data Exploration:**
Counting and visualizing the distribution of Normal and Pneumonia images in the training, validation, and test sets.
Understanding the dataset's characteristics and ensuring a balanced representation of both classes.

**CNN Model Architecture:**
Creating a CNN architecture using Keras to effectively capture features from chest X-ray images.
Utilizing convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and dense layers for classification.
Configuring the model for binary classification using the sigmoid activation function.

**Data Augmentation and Model Compilation:**
Employing data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization on the training set.
Compiling the model with appropriate loss function (binary cross-entropy) and optimizer (Adam).

**Model Training:**
Training the model on the augmented training set with a specified number of epochs.
Monitoring training progress, including training and validation accuracy and loss.

**Model Evaluation:**
Assessing the model's performance on the test set to measure its ability to correctly classify Normal and Pneumonia cases.
Generating a confusion matrix and visualizing the results to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.
Loading new chest X-ray images from both Normal and Pneumonia classes to validate the model's performance on unseen data.

**Next Steps:**
Considering further fine-tuning or optimization strategies based on evaluation results.
Exploring deployment options for integrating the model into a user-friendly tool for medical professionals.
Continuous improvement and validation of the model as more data becomes available.
**Expected Outcomes:**
The project aims to deliver a robust and accurate chest X-ray image classification model for pneumonia detection. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model should contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions.
